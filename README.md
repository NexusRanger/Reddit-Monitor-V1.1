# Reddit Monitor

A new way to stay updated

Reddit Monitor is a powerful Google Apps Script that keeps you up-to-date with your favourite subreddits. With Reddit Monitor, you can:

- Receive instant email updates or regular summaries over any time period you choose.

- Get notified of new posts within 1 minute or browse overnight posts on your way to work.

- Follow live links in email notifications to read posts and replies in detail.

Setup is quick and easy - simply import the script, enter your email address and favourite subreddits, and you're ready to go. You can also filter posts by subject or user, or exclude topics that don't interest you. Reddit Monitor uses publicly available live data but because it doesn't 'write' anything to Reddit it shouldn't be affected by API changes.
