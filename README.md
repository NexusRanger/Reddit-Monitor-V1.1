# Reddit Monitor

A new way to stay updated

Reddit Monitor is a powerful Google Apps Script that keeps you up-to-date with your favourite subreddits. With Reddit Monitor, you can:

- Receive instant email updates of new posts, or regular summaries over any time period you choose.

- Get notified of new posts within 1 minute, or browse overnight posts on your way to work.

- Follow live links in email notifications to read posts and replies in detail.

- Email notification includes Post Title, Post Text, User, Karma Score, Time etc.

- Setup time â‰ˆ 2 mins

Setup is quick and easy - simply paste in the script, enter your email address and favourite subreddits, and you're ready to go. You can also filter posts by subject or user, or exclude topics that don't interest you. Reddit Monitor uses publicly available live data but because it doesn't 'write' anything to Reddit it shouldn't be affected by API changes.

# Instructions:

Open Script.Google.com  You won't need to log in if your already logged into Chrome

Click: 'New Project', clear the window and paste in the Javascript from Reddit-Monitor-V1-1.js

Or you can simply import the project from here: <a href="https://script.google.com/d/1h7hTRlp1Tet7fFuBm9iuc4fIZeSTkX0rsM76scEzION9wx5S7GhDf9dm/edit?usp=sharing">  Reddit Monitor - Google Apps Scripts</a>

 Save the script, then click Run and grant permissions
 
 No need to 'Deploy' unless you need to trigger remotely
   
 Re: permissions, you are saving this script & running it on YOUR OWN account... 
 
 ...& sending only to YOUR OWN email address & there is NO outside access
 
 Useage: set a time trigger (clock icon on left) to run: 'checkForNewPosts' 
 
 Run frequently up to 1/min for live updates, or every few hours for a regular overview
 
 Or set up two or more Scripts, run one every minuite for a favourite subreddit, and others over hours?
